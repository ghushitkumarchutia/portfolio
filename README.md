> _"Passionate about crafting clean code and beautiful interfaces."_

## 🚀 Overview

Welcome to my personal portfolio. This project represents a fusion of **technical robustness** and **aesthetic precision**. Built with **React 19** and **Tailwind CSS**, it features a custom-designed interface that emphasizes smooth interactions, inclusivity (dark/light mode), and a unique visual identity.

The design philosophy revolves around a "bento-grid" style layout, offering a clean, organized, and responsive experience that adapts seamlessly from desktop to mobile.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🎨 Dynamic Theme System**: A robust global theme context that persists user preference (Dark/Light), featuring a smooth toggle animation and high-contrast color palettes (Gold/Onyx).
- **🖱️ Custom Interaction**: An intelligent, custom-built animated cursor that morphs contextually—shifting from a precise circle to a vertical bar when hovering over text for enhanced readability.
- **⚡ High-Performance Animations**: Optimized CSS-based transitions simulate complex motion (slide-ups, marquees, gradients) without the overhead of heavy animation libraries.
- **📱 Fully Responsive**: A dual-architecture unique approach with distinct `Hero` (Desktop) and `MobileHero` components ensures a native-like feel on any device.
- **🧩 Component Architecture**: Modular design separating major sections (`About`, `Projects`, `Skills`) into self-contained, theme-aware units.
